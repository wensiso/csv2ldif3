csv2ldif2.pl CHANGELOG
----------------------

* Version 1.1 (2015-01-22)
 - Replaced JCode with perl CORE module "Encode"
 - new switch -E to change the attribute encoding (expert usage,
   most probably you never need to use this!)
 - new switch -B to disable base64 encoding
 - new switch -F to change the separator used to construct multivalued DNs
 - added content to -h help screen

Version 1.0.1 (2007-02-14 08:39:32):
* a little additional documentation
* If dn is build from several attributes, and one of this values is empty, then a error occured.
  This error is now shown; the entry will be skipped.

Version 1.0 (2007-02-12 11:01:12):
* Renamed parameter -q to -x
* Changed default behavior of (old) -q: now empty attributes are not printed by default
  To print empty fields, use the new -x parameter.
* added quoted field support:
 - new parameter -q to specify the quoting character (default: double quote ")
 - csv-line-parsing gets done by own sub now
* fixed some typos in error messages
* removed last todo entry in README.txt :D

Version 0.9.2 (2007-02-08 09:39:33):
* updated extended help message
* fixed split() bug; split eats up empty fields resulting in csv parsing errors
* added todo list to README.txt
* fixed a comments typo
* fixed a small bug: if the entry is processed the first time and if a multivalued attribute
  is composed from several csv-fields then it was possible to get duplicates

Version 0.9.1 (2007-02-07 07:43:33):
* bugfix for the -s -i and -f parameter (SF Bug #1653281)
* little change to the readme (renamed csv2ldif -> csv2ldif2.pl)

Version 0.9 (2007-01-22 10:20:50):
 * initial release of csv2ldif2.pl
